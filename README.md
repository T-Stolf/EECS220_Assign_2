# EECS220_Assign_2
Testing 123
as soon as we figure the assignment out we just need to get to work 


First you want to go to window > show view > other > git > git staging
this should show you what is happening on the git side.

Then you need to download a git repository from the file menu
Go to file > import > git > projects from git > next > clone uri
in the upper three fields enter the following 
Uri : https://github.com/T-Stolf/EECS220_Assign_2.git
Host : github.com
repository path: /T-Stolf/EECS220_Assign_2.git
then select the master branch (thats the only one we need right now)
Them it will ask you where top store your local version of the branch which i suggest you leave in the git directory.
